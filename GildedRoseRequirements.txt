# Adding Items to Stock

I need to add Items to our stock. Every item has a name, sell-by date, and quality.
Quality is an integer always >= 0.

# Printing Stock List

I want to print the list of all items in stock.
The print should show today's date, and a list of all items with their name, number of days until sell-by, and their quality.

# Load Stock List and Print It

I want to load the stock list from disk and print it to the screen in the format that we agreed.

# View Stock List In Browser

I'm sick of the command line. I want to view the stock list in my browser.
The format should be the same as previous.

# When I View the Stock in a Browser It Should Update Qualities

Quality update is going to be complicated, but for now just reduce the quality of each item by one every day.

# Quality Should Not Fall Below 0

The Quality of an item is never negative.

# Items Degrade Faster After Their Sell-By Date

Once the sell-by date has passed items reduce in quality by two every day.

# Sulphuras has no Sell-By Date and doesn't degrade
